# Neural-Network-in-Medical-Analysis
Image Processing - source code presenting phases such as image pre-processing, construction of Neural Network and training of the neural network 

The source code presents the whole implementation of the neural network with thraining process
Json file contains structure of the neural network
Weights learned during training phase can be downloaded using commands found in the source code as it is a large file, however it is necessary to run the whole code
Combination of weights (in .h5 extension format) and json file allow to retrieve the whole network without repetition of the training process
